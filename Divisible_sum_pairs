Explanation

Here are the  valid pairs when :

Python 3


1










n,k = map(int,input().split())
ar = []
ar = list(map(int,input().split()))
count = 0
for i in range(len(ar)):
    
    j = i+1
    while j < len(ar):
        if ((ar[i] + ar[j]) % k) == 0:
            count += 1
        j += 1
print(count)
