Circular Array
Rotation
John Watson knows of an operation called a right circular rotation on an array of integers. One rotation
operation moves the last array element to the first position and shifts all remaining elements right one. To
test Sherlock's abilities, Watson provides Sherlock with an array of integers. Sherlock is to perform the
rotation operation a number of times then determine the value of the element at a given position.
For each array, perform a number of right circular rotations and return the value of the element at a given
index.
Input Format
The first line contains space-separated integers, , , and .
The second line contains space-separated integers, where each integer describes array element
(where ).
Each of the subsequent lines contains a single integer denoting .
Constraints
Output Format
For each query, print the value of the element at index of the rotated array on a new line.

Explanation 0
After the first rotation, the array becomes .
After the second (and final) rotation, the array becomes .
Let's refer to the array's final state as array . For each query, we just have to print the value of
on a new line:
1. , .
2. , .
3. , .


Solution:
nkq= input().split()
n = int(nkq[0])
k= int(nkq[1])
q = int(nkq[2])
q1 = []
a =[]
a = list(map(int,input().split()))
for h in range(q):
    l=int(input())
    q1.append(l)
for i in range(k):
    d = a[n-1]
    del a[n-1]
    a.insert(0,d)
for index in q1:
    print(a[index])
