Utopian Tree
The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each
summer, its height increases by 1 meter.
Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be
after growth cycles?
Input Format
The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases.
subsequent lines each contain an integer, , denoting the number of cycles for that test case.
Constraints
Output Format
For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after cycles. Each height must be printed on a
new line.
Sample Input
3
0
1
4
Sample Output
1
2
7
Explanation
There are 3 test cases.
In the first case ( ), the initial height ( ) of the tree remains unchanged.
In the second case ( ), the tree doubles in height and is meters tall after the spring cycle.
In the third case ( ), the tree doubles its height in spring ( ), then grows a meter in summer (
), then doubles after the next spring ( ), and grows another meter after summer ( ).
Thus, at the end of 4 cycles, its height is meters.

# Complete the utopianTree function below.
def utopianTree(n):
    initial_height =1
    for i in range(0,n+1):
        height = 0
        if i ==0:
            height = initial_height +0
            initial_height = height
        elif i % 2 != 0: # half year 
            height = (initial_height * 2)
            initial_height = height
        elif i % 2 == 0: #Full year 
            height = initial_height+ 1
            initial_height = height
    return initial_height
